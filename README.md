# xmip-core-transport-iec-60870-5-104

IEC 60870-5-104 transport: one ASDU is one Stream, the APCI sequence numbers beside it; a Location listens as the controlled station or connects as the controlling one. A technology of [xmip-core-transport](https://github.com/IlleNilsson/xmip-core-transport).

A Receive Location keeps its listener, bound on the first receive (`transport::kept::Kept`): a peer that connects between two receives is queued and taken by the next, where until 2026-09-27 each receive bound a listener of its own and a peer between receives was refused.

## Toolchain

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the toolchain for the whole estate. Do not change it
here.

## Verification

The included workflow is manual-only and calls the versioned shared workflow at
`IlleNilsson/.github@v1`.
